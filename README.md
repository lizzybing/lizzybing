### Hi there, I'm Lizzy! ğŸ‘‹

I am a current Senior at Binghamton University. My major is Mathematics and I am interested in persuing a Masters degree in Data Analytics. 

Right now, I'm taking many high level math classes, as well as learning Python!

One day I want to learn SQL, and I am already familiar with R.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a lab about Web Scraping
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Group Theory
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can never come up with fun facts. That's fun, right?
